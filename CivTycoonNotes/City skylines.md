I would like this game to be like city skylines where the player has to segment off land to allow for people to build houses and stores and industries. Additionally the user has to provide high level service like fire, police, and education. They will also have to build roads to connect the people. The whole idea of the game is to balance out what you have and what you can build because building things costs a ton of money and you must collect enough from taxes.

Some higher level ideas would be:
people/cars moving on the roads
public transit
moving vehicles
Map zooming und minimap
